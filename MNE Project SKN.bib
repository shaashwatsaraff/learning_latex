Here we present a fast, easy and inexpensive microstructuration method for the fabrication of novel, flexible, transparent and biocompatible microfluidic devices. Using a simple hot press, we demonstrate the rapid (30 s) production of various microfluidic prototypes embossed in a commercially available soft thermoplastic elastomer (sTPE). This styrenic block copolymer (BCP) material is as flexible as PDMS and as thermoformable as classical thermoplastics. It exhibits high fidelity of replication using SU-8 and epoxy master molds in a highly convenient low-isobar (0.4 bar) and iso-thermal process. Microfluidic devices can then be easily sealed using either a simple hot plate or even a room-temperature assembly, allowing them to sustain liquid pressures of 2 and 0.6 bar, respectively. The excellent sorption and biocompatibility properties of the microchips were validated via a standard rhodamine dye assay as well as a sensitive yeast cell-based assay. The morphology and composition of the surface area after plasma treatment for hydrophilization purposes are stable and show constant and homogenous distribution of block nanodomains (∼22° after 4 days). These domains, which are evenly distributed on the nanoscale, therefore account for the uniform and convenient surface of a “microfluidic scale device”. To our knowledge, this is the first thermoplastic elastomer material that can be used for fast and reliable fabrication and assembly of microdevices while maintaining a high and stable hydrophilicity.},

Therefore, the primary objectives of this study were to evaluate the device's error in tibial contact force when used according to and contrary to the manufacturer's instructions, and also to evaluate the device's error in anterior-posterior (A-P) and medial-lateral (M-L) contact locations. The error in tibial contact force in one-compartment distributed loading was evaluated by applying known forces in ranges within and exceeding that instructed by the manufacturer, with rezeroing as instructed by the manufacturer, and without rezeroing. The error in tibial contact location in one-compartment concentrated loading was evaluated by applying known forces at known locations on the articular surface. Exceeding the maximum allowable load and not rezeroing did not adversely affect the bias (i.e., average error) (p \&gt; 0.05). The maximum absolute bias without rezeroing was 2.9 lbf. Rezeroing more than doubled the bias. The maximum root-mean-squared error in tibial contact location was 1.5 mm in the A-P direction. The device measures tibial contact force with comparable error well above the maximum allowable load and without rezeroing, contrary to the manufacturer's instructions.},

Recently, promising new technologies have been developed in knee arthroplasty, and could improve the functional outcomes. The aim of this paper was to present some new technologies in TKA, their current concepts, their advantages, and limitations. The patient-specific instrumentations can allow an improvement of implant positioning and limb alignment, but no difference is found for functional outcomes. The customized implants are conceived to reproduce the native knee anatomy and to reproduce its biomechanics. The sensors have to aim to give objective data on ligaments balancing during TKA. Few studies are published on the results at mid-term of these two devices currently. The accelerometers are smart tools developed to improve the TKA alignment. Their benefits remain yet controversial. The robotic-assisted systems allow an accurate and reproducible bone preparation due to a robotic interface, with a 3D surgical planning, based on preoperative 3D imaging or not. This promising system, nevertheless, has some limits. The new technologies in TKA are very attractive and have constantly evolved. Nevertheless, some limitations persist and could be improved by artificial intelligence and predictive modeling.},

	abstract = {Background
Despite advances in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) technology, up to 1 in 5 patients remain dissatisfied. This study sought to evaluate if sensor-guided knee balancing improves postoperative clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction compared to a conventional gap balancing technique.
Methods
We undertook a prospective double-blind randomized controlled trial of patients presenting for elective primary TKA to determine a difference in TKA soft tissue balance between a standard gap balancing (tensiometer) approach compared to augmenting the balance using a sensor-guided device. The sensor-guided experimental group had adjustments made to achieve a balanced knee to within 15 pounds of intercompartmental pressure difference. Secondary outcomes included differences in clinical outcome scores at 6 months and 1 year postoperative, including the Oxford Knee Score and Knee Society Score and patient satisfaction.
Results
The sample comprised of 152 patients, 76 controls and 76 experimental sensor-guided cases. Within the control group, 36\% (27/76) of knees were unbalanced based on an average coronal plane intercompartmental difference {\textgreater}15 pounds, compared to only 5.3\% (4/76) within the experimental group (P {\textless} .0001). There were no significant differences in 1-year postoperative flexion, Knee Society Score, or Oxford scores. Overall, TKA patient satisfaction at 1 year was comparable, with 81\% of controls and experimental cases reporting they were very satisfied (P = .992).
Conclusion
Despite the use of the sensor-guided knee balancer device to provide additional quantitative feedback in the evaluation of the soft tissue envelope during TKA, we were unable to demonstrate improved clinical outcomes or patient satisfaction compared to our conventional gap balancing technique.},

	abstract = {Partial knee arthroplasty (PKA), either medial or lateral unicompartmental knee artroplasty (UKA) or patellofemoral arthroplasty (PFA) are a good option in suitable patients and have the advantages of reduced operative trauma, preservation of both cruciate ligaments and bone stock, and restoration of normal kinematics within the knee joint. However, questions remain concerning long-term survival. The goal of this review article was to present the long-term results of medial and lateral UKA, PFA and combined compartmental arthroplasty for multicompartmental disease. Medium- and long-term studies suggest reasonable outcomes at ten years with survival greater than 95\% in UKA performed for medial osteoarthritis or osteonecrosis, and similarly for lateral UKA, particularly when fixed-bearing implants are used. Disappointing long-term outcomes have been observed with the first generation of patellofemoral implants, as well as early Bi-Uni (ie, combined medial and lateral UKA) or Bicompartmental (combined UKA and PFA) implants due to design and fixation issues. Promising short- and med-term results with the newer generations of PFAs and bicompartmental arthroplasties will require long-term confirmation.

The surface energy of Kapton HN increased quickly upon KOH treatment due to the formation of polar polyamate. Prolonged treatment led to a jump in surface energy that we ascribe to the onset of etching causing increased surface roughness. Potassium depth profiles of treated Kapton HN samples measured by XPS and TOF-SIMS demonstrated that during the first 10 minutes of 1 M KOH treatment the modification depth increased rapidly. Thereafter the thickness of the modified layer no longer increased. For Kapton H films, however, the development of etching was much slower and a steady increase in modification depth was observed even after long treatment times. The different behaviours between Kapton HN and Kapton H films in alkali solutions are analysed and discussed. Copyright © 2003 Society of Chemical Industry},

	abstract = {Smart implants are implantable devices that provide not only therapeutic benefits but also have diagnostic capabilities. The integration of smart implants into daily clinical practice has the potential for massive cost savings to the health care system. Applications for smart orthopedic implants have been identified for knee arthroplasty, hip arthroplasty, spine fusion, fracture fixation and others. To date, smart orthopedic implants have been used to measure physical parameters from inside the body, including pressure, force, strain, displacement, proximity and temperature. The measurement of physical stimuli is achieved through integration of application-specific technology with the implant. Data from smart implants have led to refinements in implant design, surgical technique and strategies for postoperative care and rehabilitation. In spite of decades of research, with very few exceptions, smart implants have not yet become a part of daily clinical practice. This is largely because integration of current sensor technology necessitates significant modification to the implants. While the technology underlying smart implants has matured significantly over the last several decades, there are still significant technical challenges that need to be overcome before smart implants become part of mainstream health care. Sensors for next-generation smart implants will be small, simple, robust and inexpensive and will necessitate little to no modification to existing implant designs. With rapidly advancing technology, the widespread implementation of smart implants is near. New sensor technology that minimizes modifications to existing implants is the key to enabling smart implants into daily clinical practice.},

	abstract = {Background 
        Revision THA and TKA are growing and important clinical and economic challenges. Healthcare systems tend to combine revision joint replacement procedures into a single service line, and differences between revision THA and revision TKA remain incompletely characterized. These differences carry implications for guiding care and resource allocation. We therefore evaluated epidemiologic trends associated with revision THAs and TKAs.
        Questions/purposes 
        We sought to determine differences in (1) the number of patients undergoing revision TKA and THA and respective demographic trends; (2) differences in the indications for and types of revision TKA and THA; (3) differences in patient severity of illness scoring between THA and TKA; and (4) differences in resource utilization (including cost and length of stay [LOS]) between revision THA and TKA.
        Methods 
        The Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) was used to evaluate 235,857 revision THAs and 301,718 revision TKAs between October 1, 2005 and December 31, 2010. Patient characteristics, procedure information, and resource utilization were compared across revision THAs and TKAs. A revision burden (ratio of number of revisions to total number of revision and primary surgeries) was calculated for hip and knee procedures. Severity of illness scoring and cost calculations were derived from the NIS. As our study was principally descriptive, statistical analyses generally were not performed; however, owing to the large sample size available to us through this NIS analysis, even small observed differences presented are likely to be highly statistically significant.
        Results 
        Revision TKAs increased by 39\% (revision burden, 9.1\%-9.6\%) and THAs increased by 23\% (revision burden, 15.4\%-14.6\%). Revision THAs were performed more often in older patients compared with revision TKAs. Periprosthetic joint infection (25\%) and mechanical loosening (19\%) were the most common reasons for revision TKA compared with dislocation (22\%) and mechanical loosening (20\%) for revision THA. Full (all-component) revision was more common in revision THAs (43\%) than in TKAs (37\%). Patients who underwent revision THA generally were sicker ({\textgreater} 50\% major severity of illness score) than patients who underwent revision TKA (65\% moderate severity of illness score). Mean LOS was longer for revision THAs than for TKAs. Mean hospitalization costs were slightly higher for revision THA (USD 24,697 +/− USD 40,489 [SD]) than revision TKA (USD 23,130 +/− USD 36,643 [SD]). Periprosthetic joint infection and periprosthetic fracture were associated with the greatest LOS and costs for revision THAs and TKAs.
        Conclusions 
        These data could prove important for healthcare systems to appropriately allocate resources to hip and knee procedures: the revision burden for THA is 52\% greater than for TKA, but revision TKAs are increasing at a faster rate. Likewise, the treating clinician should understand that while both revision THAs and TKAs bear significant clinical and economic costs, patients undergoing revision THA tend to be older, sicker, and have greater costs of care.},

	abstract = {There are many different approaches to adhesive bonding of plastics depending on the type of plastic. Difficult to bond plastics usually exhibit two characteristics, surface crystal structure or low surface energy. The surface energy can vary quite significantly depending on the chemistry of the plastic surface and is one of the main factors that determine wetting characteristics of the adhesive on the solid substrate or adherend. The bonding characteristics of low surface energy plastic are usually quite poor with conventional adhesives. Either surface treatments or self priming adhesives are generally used to circumvent these adverse surface effects. Although there are many surface treatments for plastics, the main emphasis for future direction is the use of self priming adhesive systems (organoboron catalyzed acrylic adhesives). The emphasis of this chapter is to discuss bonding techniques used for adhesive bonding of difficult to bond plastics.},
